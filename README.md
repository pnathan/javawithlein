leinjava

Pure Java compile & test example using Leiningen.

I'm a lazy bum who finds Maven, Ant, and other JVM-based build systems
to be equivalent to setting your hair on fire... lein is therefore
ideal!  I had to fiddle a bit to make this system work, but it should
be useful going forward as template code for myself and anyone else.
